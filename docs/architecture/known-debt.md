# Known Debt & Current-State Realities

This file holds OpenClip's **current-state notes** — the places where the code has not yet
reached the target architecture. These change more often than the hard rules, so they are
tracked here rather than in `AGENTS.md`. Keep this file current when you touch any of these
areas; stale debt notes are worse than none.

## Settings Migration (UserDefaults → SettingsStore)

- The typed settings abstraction is `SettingsStore` + `SettingKey<T>` (see `Sources/Core/Settings/`).
  New settings code must route through it.
- **AI-config `@AppStorage` surface remains** (`AIServiceManager` keys), and `completionCopyToClipboard`
  / popup theme still read via `@AppStorage`, but the theme keys (`popupTheme`,
  `popupThemeColor`) now reference `SettingKey` definitions instead of raw literals. Migrating to
  `SettingsStore` is ongoing — **don't add new direct call sites.** (`startAtLogin` was consolidated
  onto `SettingKey.startAtLogin` — `LaunchAtLoginManager` persists through `DefaultSettingsStore`.)
- **Secrets live in SecretStore, not UserDefaults or macOS Keychain.** Sensitive credentials
  (the cloud AI API key and action secret options) use `SecretStore` (`~/.openclip/secrets.json`
  with 0600 POSIX permissions), replacing macOS Keychain to avoid code-signing ACL prompts.
  `AIServiceManager.cloudAPIKey` is `@Published`, backed by `SecretStore` (account `aiCloudAPIKey`);
  do not convert it back to `@AppStorage`. A one-time migration reads the old `UserDefaults`
  `"aiCloudAPIKey"` key, then deletes it.
- **`isAppEnabled` is consolidated** onto `SettingKey.isAppEnabled` — the status bar item and the
  Preferences toggle read/write it through `DefaultSettingsStore`. It means **"Appear
  Automatically"** (its label in both places): it owns the selection monitor's passive auto-show and
  nothing else. It is applied in `MacSelectionMonitor.deliverSelection` (the mouse-release/keyboard
  path) as the global form of the per-app `hotkeyOnly` rule; the explicit **Hold Mouse to Trigger**
  gesture delivers from `handleMouseDown` and is exempt, so off + hold = hold-only mode. The ⌥⌘C
  hotkey is an explicit request and is deliberately *not* gated on it.
  `HotkeyManager.triggerAllowed` gates on the
  real kill switches instead: Pause (`pauseUntilTimestamp`), app exclusion, per-app `disabled`. Builtin store-backed actions
  (`CalculateAction`, `CalendarAction`, `SearchAction`) accept an injected `SettingsStore` via
  `BuiltinRegistry.makeCoreBuiltins(settingsStore:)`.
- **Menu bar visibility is store-backed and reversible.** `SettingKey.showMenuBarIcon` defaults to
  true. `StatusBarController` removes/recreates its `NSStatusItem` immediately when the General-tab
  toggle changes, while reopening the running app presents Preferences so a hidden icon can be
  restored without terminating OpenClip.
- **`ActionConfigSheet` is gone** (dead code — zero presenting call sites; its `useText` keys were
  write-only). Removing it also dropped the only UI that wrote `SettingKey.searchURL` /
  `SettingKey.calculateMode`; the actions still read those keys (defaults apply). Search-engine
  configurability is **restored** via the built-in Search action's preset picker in the Preferences
  edit sheet (`DynamicActionConfigView` — Google / DuckDuckGo / Kagi / Brave / Bing / Ecosia /
  Custom), which writes the option-store key `action.builtin.search.option.url`
  (`SearchEnginePreset` in Core holds the curated catalog); calculate-result-mode still has no
  Preferences surface.
  `ConfigurableAction` keeps only `preferenceIconName` (used by `tableIcon`/`rowIcon` icon fallback).
- **Dynamic action option keys** (`JavaScriptAction`, `AppleScriptAction`): the target pattern is
  `SettingKey<String>("action.<id>.option.<identifier>", defaultValue:)` via `SettingsStore`. The JS
  path already reads through the injected `optionStore` (`OpenClipJSHost` reads options read-only via
  `ActionOptionReading`); `AppleScriptAction` does not consume options today.

## Action Seams Already Implemented

- **Coordinator composition is done.** `ActionCoordinator.loadInitialState()` wires `ExtensionManager`
  to the registry via `onRegister`/`onUnregister`; the manager never calls `ActionRegistry.shared`
  directly. GUI-authored actions persist as manifest packages (via `CustomActionManifestWriter`);
  `custom_actions.json`/`CustomActionManager` are retired.
- **Shell runtimes share one executor.** `ScriptAction` script files and `CustomAction.shellScript`
  both run through `ShellProcessRunner` (one watchdog; `TimeoutFlag`/`OnceGate` live in
  `ShellProcessRunner.swift`) and translate stdout JSON via `ShellResultMapper`; `NSUserNotification`
  is gone (`.notify` is handled by the effect door via `UNUserNotificationCenter`). AppleScript
  joins the same executor via `AppleScriptRunner` (osascript subprocess), so no code runs
  `NSAppleScript` in-process anymore. Since the hang fix, the watchdog is a **GCD timer** (immune
  to Swift-concurrency-pool starvation) and pipe output is read via GCD `readabilityHandler` (never
  a blocking `readToEnd()`, so a stuck child can't permanently consume a cooperative thread), with
  stdin seeded and closed synchronously so a script reading stdin always sees EOF. Both pipe
  accumulators are drained **before** their buffers are read: `waitUntilExit()` returns when the
  direct child exits, so the readability handler can still be behind, or not have run at all. The
  drain is bounded — it waits `grace` (2 s) for EOF, reads what is pending, then closes the handle —
  so it captures output that reached the pipe before that deadline. A descendant that writes after
  the close still loses its output.
- **Delivery is resolved by `ActionResultDelivery`, not per-runtime translation.** Runtimes
  (`OpenClipJSHost.run`, `ShellResultMapper`, kind actions) return only raw results; implicitly
  returned text (JS string return, AppleScript output, shell stdout, text snippets) is emitted as
  `.text` and the paste-vs-copy/preview delivery decision (Select → Probe → Toast) is applied
  downstream from the action's author-declared output contract (`output` and `result` in manifest /
  `ActionChrome`), optional user per-action delivery override (`ActionCustomizationManager`),
  the universal secondary-click Clipboard Invariant (secondary click copies; or previews if primary is copy),
  and the unified paste availability. The flawed global settings (`primaryClickBehavior`/
  `secondaryClickBehavior`) are **fully removed**. The old `after` translator (the pre-refactor `after` orchestration step and its
  adapter) is **fully removed**. Synchronous JavaScript (including the top-level synchronous phase
  of async actions) is bounded by JavaScriptCore's VM execution-time limit, so a timeout unwinds
  `evaluateScript` and releases its sync-evaluation gate slot. Idle promise waiting is bounded by
  the `TimeoutFlag` watchdog (60 s by default), and Swift task cancellation remains cooperative.
  A fetch response that arrives after the evaluation ends is discarded (`FetchTaskBox.isEnded`);
  the host does not call the JavaScript VM for it (issue #40). Residual: retain cycles in
  `JSNativeFetch` (`nativeFetchBlock` → `contextBox`/`context`; `jsonBlock` → `JSContextBox`) and
  `PromiseState` (`JSValue?` → `JSValue.context`) keep the finished `JSContext` alive — this is
  **line-cited analysis, not empirically probed**. `PolicySession` does not invalidate its
  `URLSession`. A guarded `CFRunLoopPerformBlock` can still sit on the shared run loop and hold
  those references. Do not break a cycle unless the final release of `JSValue`/`JSContext` is
  guaranteed to land on the JS thread; otherwise an off-thread release becomes a memory-safety
  hazard.
- **Custom Action Groups use canonical IDs with dynamic materialization and strict $\ge 2$ member invariant.**
  User-defined action groups are defined via `ActionGroupDef` (`Sources/Core/Actions/ActionGroupDef.swift`),
  stored as JSON in `SettingKey.actionGroups`. Rather than rewriting action identifiers with virtual ID
  prefixes (e.g. `vgroup.<id>.<actionID>`), grouped actions retain their exact canonical IDs
  (`builtin.copy`, `com.user.ext.action`). `ActionRegistry` dynamically materializes `CustomGroupAction`
  (`Sources/Core/Actions/CustomGroupAction.swift`, conforming to `Action` and `SubActionProviding`)
  group rows, injecting them contiguously before their member actions in `actions`, while `SettingKey.actionOrder`
  strictly stores real, canonical IDs (excluding synthetic group headers and AI presets). `ActionCoordinator`
  manages the full group lifecycle (`createGroup`, `updateGroup`, `ungroup`, `removeFromGroup`, `loadGroupDefs`,
  `pruneOrphans`), automatically enforcing the strict $\ge 2$ member invariant: when members are uninstalled
  or removed, any group dropping below 2 members is immediately dissolved. Availability resolution in
  `ActionRegistry.availableActions(for:)` maps canonical IDs to owning custom groups to hide member actions
  when their parent group is disabled or filtered out.

## Extension JS Module Runtime

- **JS file scripts run in module mode (CommonJS).** A `javascript` action with `"script"` gets
  `require`/`module`/`exports`/`__dirname` and can split across local files; resolution is Node-style
  and contained to the package directory (`OpenClipModuleLoader` + `Constants.isPathSafe`), with
  `../`/symlink escapes, absolute paths, and bare/Node-builtin specifiers rejected. Containment is
  checked on the final symlink-resolved candidate, including the appended `.js` / `index.js`
  (issue #39). Folder installs are **not** scanned for symlinks at install time — only `.zip`
  entries are (`validateZipEntries`) — and `ExtensionPackageHashResolver` skips out-of-package
  symlink targets from the trust hash, so the loader is the last line of defense for file reads.
  Containment verification is bound directly to the open file descriptor via `fcntl(F_GETPATH)`
  before reading, preventing check-then-read races. Inline `scriptCode` actions have no modules
  (byte-identical legacy behavior).
- **Third-party libraries live on the author side, not the host.** npm deps are bundled by the
  author with esbuild (`--platform=browser --target=es2020`) into `dist/main.js`; the host loader is
  **`.js`-only**, so TypeScript works only through the bundle path (`--with-npm` scaffold). Node
  builtins are rejected at build time by the esbuild platform — they can never run.
- **The consent gate has landed; capability *enforcement* remains future work.** Nothing runs until
  a package is enabled (fail-closed trust states `seen`/`trusted`/`revoked` behind a single
  trust-model consent surface), and a tamper-watch auto-disables a trusted package whose content
  hash changed at a later load. Still future: JIT permission prompts, gating `fetch`/`keyPress`/
  `runShortcut`, seeding `ManifestCapabilityGate`, and a JS honesty-scan acting on mismatches.
  Extensions still execute in-process with the app's user context; module containment bounds file
  reads but is not a privilege boundary.

## Presentation / Rule Holes

- **No `switch action.id` fallback remains.** `ActionCustomizationManager.tableIcon()` resolves via
  `ConfigurableAction.preferenceIconName` — the legacy block is gone. Keep it that way: never add
  id-string switches in presentation.

## Action-Search Palette & Popup Growth

- **Content-driven panel growth has no controller callback.** The `NSHostingView` auto-resizes the
  panel window top-anchored when its SwiftUI content grows (e.g. entering search mode);
  `onPreferenceChange`/`onContentSizeChange` never fires for this and `sizingOptions` has no effect.
  The only reliable hook is `PopupPanel.setFrame` (`PopupPanel.swift:42`): when
  `pinBottomEdgeOnResize` is set it keeps the bottom edge fixed so results-above-the-field growth
  never shoves the popup. For the search palette the pin is one-shot
  (`releasesBottomPinAfterGrowth`): it covers the entry growth only, so the palette's height can
  follow the result count without sliding the field; `exitSearch()` re-arms it for the search→bar
  collapse after restoring the bar's bottom edge (Esc no longer jumps the popup). Both flags are
  cleared by `show(for:)` and `hide()` before intentional placement.
- **Search and content modes are the two key exceptions to the never-key rule.** `PopupPanel.allowsKey`
  enables `canBecomeKey`/`canBecomeMain` in both modes (`PopupPanel.swift:19`), routed through the
  same `enterKeyMode()`/`exitKeyMode()` primitives (`PopupWindowController.swift:196,206`). A
  `@FocusState`-in-onAppear request is silently dropped on macOS, so search forces focus via
  `focusSearchField()` on the next run-loop turn (`PopupWindowController.swift:245`);
  `previousFrontmostApp` is captured once per session (on `show(for:)`/`enterKeyMode`, never
  re-captured mid-session) and re-activated on `exitKeyMode`/`hide`.
- **Search and content modes suspend popup dismissal.** The distance auto-dismiss and the key/scroll
  dismissals in `handleEvent` are skipped while `modeStore.mode == .search` or `.content`
  (`PopupWindowController.swift:591,612,622`), so typing with the mouse elsewhere doesn't close the
  palette, and the result card stays open until it is collapsed or the popup hides.
- **The floating bubble panel is gone; content renders inline.** The second `PopupPanel` (and its
  `showBubble`/`hideBubble`/`bubbleBlocksDismiss` machinery) was removed — all action/AI/status
  content renders inside the single panel via `.content` mode (`PopupModeStore`) as a native
  SwiftUI `ResultCardView`. The card is general, not AI-specific: any text-returning action lands
  there with its customization-resolved icon (`DeliveryContext.actionIcon`, snapshotted by the same
  perform paths as `actionTitle`); AI streaming deliveries pass no icon and keep the sparkles glyph. `StatusBadgeModel` and the old `.info`/`.result`/`.menu` emphasis
  model are gone, and the inline status banner is gone too: every `StatusFeedback` renders as a
  floating toast (`ToastPanelController`) with no queue — a status shows over the card — and
  `showsLoading` actions (manifest `"loading"`) use the early-close spinner toast.
- **`MathEvaluator` replaced crash-prone `NSExpression`.** `CalculateAction` used to run
  `NSExpression(format:)`, which throws an **uncaught Objective-C exception** on malformed selection
  text like `+` or `1+` (crash). The pure-Swift `MathEvaluator` (`Sources/Core/Actions/MathEvaluator.swift`)
  returns nil (never traps) and properly supports `%` modulo. Regression coverage in
  `Tests/OpenClipTests/CalculateActionTests.swift`.
- **Search rows render icons strictly `[icon | text]`.** A `.text` icon in the icon column would
  duplicate the title, so `PopupSearchView.rowIcon` falls back to `ConfigurableAction.preferenceIconName`; all four
  `ActionIcon` cases render through the shared `ActionIconView` (`Sources/OpenClip/UI/Icons/ActionIconView.swift`),
  including Iconify-format symbols (`prefix:name`). The popup bar keeps its own `iconView(for:)`
  (`PopupView.swift`) because text icons there need natural width + horizontal padding, not a fixed frame.
- **Popup sizing constants live in the App target.** `PopupMetrics`
  (`Sources/OpenClip/UI/Popup/PopupMetrics.swift`) holds the UI-only values — `searchMaxRows`
  (5), `searchResultRowHeight` (32), `searchPeekRowFraction` (0.5), `popupMaxHeight` (300, the
  shared height cap for the popup panel — lifted per-session via `PopupPanel.heightCap` while the
  result card shows, since a user-resized card may be taller), the AI card bounds
  (`aiCardMinWidth` 220 / `aiCardIdealWidth` 320 / `aiCardMaxWidth` 360 / `aiCardMinHeight` 200 /
  `aiCardMaxHeight` 280 — the max bounds only cap the content-driven default; the card's and the
  palette's resize handles go up to the screen, see `PopupResizeGeometry`, with the palette's own
  floor `searchPaletteMinWidth` 240 / `searchPaletteMinHeight` 128), plus placement/dismissal
  distances. The remembered card and palette sizes are the popup preferences declared in the App
  target (`SettingKey+ResultCard.swift`, `SettingKey+SearchPalette.swift`, next to
  `SettingKey+MenuBar.swift`) because they are pure presentation. `Core/Selection/Constants.swift` keeps only
  domain/runtime constants (timeouts, key codes, env vars, manifest keys).

## AI Providers

- **Apple Intelligence is gated by one availability source.** `AppleIntelligenceAvailability`
  (`Sources/OpenClip/AI/AppleIntelligenceAvailability.swift`) folds the `#available(macOS 26.0, *)`
  floor together with `SystemLanguageModel.default.availability` (`deviceNotEligible`,
  `appleIntelligenceNotEnabled`, `modelNotReady`) into one `Status`, and owns the copy for each. The
  Preferences status row (`AIConfigureForm`) and the provider's runtime errors both read it, so they
  can't disagree about *why* the feature is off. The Apple picker segment is still selectable on
  unsupported machines — it explains rather than disables.
- **The Apple provider uses guided generation, not tag scraping.** `AppleIntelligenceResponse`
  (`@Generable`, in `AppleIntelligenceProvider.swift`) declares `result`/`title`, so the framework
  constrains the model's output; the provider re-emits those fields via
  `AIRequestSupport.taggedResponse` into the `<result>`/`<title>` contract that the palette, result
  card, and save-as-tool flows already parse. `systemPrompt(structuredResult:)` swaps the tag
  instructions for schema-field wording, because asking for tags would make the model embed them
  inside the fields; `taggedResponse` additionally runs values through `stripTagMarkup` for the same
  reason, since the palette's text-shaped prompts still say "inside <title> tags".
- **One name per response.** `<title>` carries the short name for the work — a task heading for the
  answer card, or a reusable action name when saving a palette instruction as an AI tool. Which
  style to produce is the flow's business and lives only in the prompt wording
  (`PaletteAIPrompt.saveToolTaskPrompt`); one generated name serves both the preset title and the
  card heading in the save flow.
- **`tokenCount` is only used as a pre-flight guard.** The provider counts tokens (macOS 26.4+) and
  compares against `contextSize` only when the input exceeds `tokenBudgetCheckThreshold` (2000
  chars), throwing `requestTooLarge` before paying for a doomed generation. Oversized selections are
  **not** auto-routed to another provider.
- **macOS 27 APIs are not yet adopted.** `PrivateCloudComputeLanguageModel`, the new `LanguageModel`
  protocol, and the Vision-backed tools (OCRTool/BarcodeReaderTool) are macOS 27 / Xcode 27 only and
  are absent from the 26.5 SDK this repo builds against, so they cannot be referenced at all
  (`#if canImport(FoundationModels)` is already true on 26.x, so a symbol reference breaks the
  build rather than failing at runtime). Adding Private Cloud Compute and the model-abstraction
  refactor is deferred until the toolchain is upgraded.

## Unused / Latent

- **`ActionContext.modifiers` is currently unused.** No action reads it; `PopupWindowController`
  passes `modifiers: []`. The click intent itself *is* plumbed: `ActionContext.isSecondaryClick` is
  set from
  the run's resolved intent by the bar/sub-bar/palette perform paths (right-click or ⇧-click via
  the bar/sub-bar mouse intent; ⇧⏎ and the ⇧⏎ footer badge via the palette's own `replace` flag,
  passed explicitly through `onWillPerformAction`/`onRunLoadingAction`) and read by `DefineAction`
  to copy a definition headlessly. True modifier keys (⌘/⌥) still don't reach actions.
- **Paste delivery is now standardized but has a probe reliance.** Leaf `.paste` results are
  re-decided by `ActionResultDelivery` (App target) per the rule in the dev-guide §5b: a secondary
  click uses the declared `secondary` outcome (else derives `.copy` from a `.paste` primary), and
  the **unified** `PasteAvailability` answer (per-app rules win, AX `PasteAvailabilityProbe` fills
  in) downgrades a chosen `.paste` to `.copy` when it says no; otherwise the requested paste is
  honored. The delivery inputs are snapshotted at perform time — before
  the dismissing `hide()` clears the session context — so `denyPaste` holds even for pastes that
  dismiss the popup, and the AI card's Paste/Copy buttons are explicit requests
  (`performCardEffect`) that carry no delivery context and are never re-decided. The live probe
  (`PasteAvailabilityProbe`) needs
  Accessibility permission and
  walks the target's Edit ▸ Paste AX menu item; without AX it returns "unknown" and delivery falls
  back to copy (safe but means paste never happens for AX-less users). The same unified decision drives
  `modeStore.canPaste`, which hides the card's Paste button and the bar/search Paste + Cut
  (`PasteRequiringAction`) actions on a confirmed cannot-paste; unknown keeps them visible. The
  probe is started by the trigger sites in parallel with selection retrieval and applied before the
  first frame (probe-before-render, nothing cached), so a same-app focus-context change re-probes
  cleanly. The click-intent capture reads
  only ⇧ (not ⌘/⌥); the bar/sub-bar take it from mouse-down, while the palette resolves it itself
  (`replace` for ⇧⏎ / the ⇧⏎ badge, else the captured mouse intent) and passes it explicitly into
  the delivery snapshot, and entering the palette resets `pendingClickIntent` so a keyboard run
  never inherits the right-click that opened a group's scoped palette. Since Task 4, each action's
  declared `Action.delivery` (a distinct
  secondary outcome + per-click `primaryToast`/`secondaryToast`) is snapshotted alongside the click
  intent and fed into `resolve`, and the returned tuple's toast is rendered directly — the manual
  `isDowngradedToCopy`/`isCopyDefinition` inline toast detection was removed in favor of the resolved
  `.toast`. Since Task 8, a script-emitted `.toast` (or any result whose `containsToast` is true)
  suppresses the delivery companion toast entirely — one toast per run — and `keepVisible: true`
  stops a toast's auto-dismiss and keeps the popup open (a `.toast` dismisses by default). Only the
  SwiftUI inline perform path snapshots via the new `onWillPerformAction` closure;
  the completion-button paste path (`PopupView` `onResult(.paste(word))`) routes through
  `deliverResult`, which clears `pendingDelivery` right after its snapshot (single-use per perform),
  so a prior non-dismissing action's declared delivery can never leak onto a completion paste. The
  force-copy probe short-circuit skips the AX walk for a secondary click whose outcome is a copy;
  a declared `.paste` secondary is the exception and still probes, so it is honored when the target
  can paste (and downgrades to copy when it cannot). Implicitly returned text
  (runtimes emit `.text`, never auto-dismissing) is resolved by `ActionResultDelivery.resolve`
  using the action's author output contract (`output` and `result` in manifest / `ActionChrome`),
  optional user per-action delivery override (`ActionCustomizationManager`), the universal secondary-click
  Clipboard Invariant, and unified AX paste availability: a paste outcome probes like any paste
  and downgrades to copy when the target can't paste, a copy outcome delivers a native copy with no toast,
  and a preview outcome keeps the popup open for the card render — dismissal for `.text` is decided by
  the controller's `shouldDismiss`, not `dismissesPopup`. The loading re-show path (`settleLoadingResult`)
  re-creates the popup from the pre-early-close selection snapshot to present the card.
  - **Target application and delivery context snapshotted before perform.** Asynchronous actions snapshot
    the target application, app policy, and declared delivery into an `inFlightDeliveryContext` (or local task
    constant) before performing. If the user switches applications while an asynchronous action is executing,
    `resolveDelivery` detects that the target application is no longer active and safely downgrades `.paste`
    to `.copy` with a "Copied" toast to prevent pasting into the newly focused application.
  - **Re-show binds to the current frontmost app.** The loading-preview re-show
    (`settleLoadingResult`) re-creates the popup from the selection snapshot, but `hide()`
    clears `previousFrontmostApp`, so the re-show re-captures whatever is frontmost at settle
    time — if the user switched apps during a multi-second spinner, dismissal reactivates that
    app. The card's paste probe correctly targets the snapshotted app; only dismissal's
    reactivation is affected.
  - **`.text` inside a `.sequence` is unhandled.** Runtimes emit `.text` only as a lone result
    today, so a `.text` inside a sequence is defensive-only; if the runtime surface ever grows to
    emit `.text` in sequences, the tree-walk needs explicit handling.
- **HotkeyManager.executor pattern** (`HotkeyManager.swift:22`): a latent `Task { @MainActor in`
  inside the shortcut callback could be hardened to an explicit executor; optional.

## Concurrency

- **Residual non-interruptible paths (documented).** Two spots remain that a hostile
  or hung target can make block a background thread:
  (1) `SelectionRetrievalCoordinator.pressEditCopyMenu` starts an AXPress on the dedicated
  `com.openclip.ax-inspect` queue. The `pasteboardCopyTimeout` poll does not stop that press.
  A blocked target can occupy one queue worker until AX returns or
  `AXUIElementSetMessagingTimeout` (`Constants.axReadTimeout`) ends the call.
  The `inspectGate` permit is not held for that duration.
  `pressCopyMenuWithWatchdog` releases the permit at the first of {press returned, `axReadTimeout`},
  same OnceResume race as inspect. The queue is concurrent, so a blocked press does not delay
  later retrieval requests (see below);
  (2) `PasteAvailabilityProbe.editPasteEnabled` walks the menu bar up to an aggregate deadline
  passed through `AXMenuNavigator.findMenuItem`. Each AX message also has a per-call limit of
  `axReadTimeout`. An abandoned walk stops at `pasteProbeTimeout` (or upon completing an in-flight message),
  so workers do not linger for minutes on the queue. The counting gate releases its permit at the deadline
  (issue #37) so subsequent probes are never delayed.
  These paths do not block the main actor.
- **AX inspect is deadline-capped.** `SelectionRetrievalCoordinator.inspectWithWatchdog` races
  `AXElementInspector.inspect` against
  `Constants.axReadTimeout` (0.5 s) via the `OnceResume` once-gate, running the blocking snapshot on
  the dedicated `com.openclip.ax-inspect` queue; an unresponsive app returns
  `nil` to the retrieval chain instead of hanging the popup.
- **Inspect concurrency is bounded, not serialized.** The old single fail-fast `axSlot` made every
  overlapping gesture (rapid re-selection, double-click, hotkey+monitor races) miss entirely and
  stayed occupied until the underlying AX call returned — one heavy page suppressed popups
  process-wide for seconds. Reads now go through a counting gate (`Constants.axMaxConcurrentInspects`,
  currently 4): concurrent reads proceed in parallel, the permit frees when the caller's watchdog
  settles (deadline or completion), and only genuinely saturated bursts skip. Menu-copy presses
  share the same gate. The permit is released at `axReadTimeout`, same as inspect.
- **The `ax-inspect` queue is concurrent, not head-of-line blocking.** All blocking AX work in the
  coordinator (the inspect snapshot and the Edit ▸ Copy AXPress) shares one concurrent
  `com.openclip.ax-inspect` queue: a hung AX call occupies one worker thread but later inspect
  snapshots and presses start on other threads, so a slow or stuck target no longer delays the next
  request's start. Each request still gets its own `axReadTimeout` deadline race.
  `PasteAvailabilityProbe` uses the same design (issue #37): a concurrent
  `com.openclip.ax-probe` queue and a counting gate (`Constants.pasteProbeMaxConcurrent`, 4).
  The side that ends the wait releases the permit at `pasteProbeTimeout`.
  The old `probeSlot` stayed occupied until the blocked AX walk returned.
  That stopped every later probe and changed all paste operations to copy.
- **Subprocess pipe reads are non-blocking (hang fix).** `ShellProcessRunner` previously read stdout/
  stderr with blocking `readToEnd()` tasks and a `Task.sleep` watchdog — both can be starved, so a
  child (or grandchild) holding a pipe open could wedge the cooperative pool and hang the test
  suite indefinitely (observed mid-suite in `ScriptActionTests.testScriptExecution`). The runner now
  uses a GCD timer watchdog + GCD `readabilityHandler` reads + synchronous stdin close. This claim
  covers only the pipe reads: `process.waitUntilExit()` still blocks its detached thread until the
  child exits — bounded at `Constants.scriptTimeout`. At timeout the watchdog starts descendant
  cleanup (the child, the process group when the child is the leader, and remaining descendants).
  `waitUntilExit()` waits only for the direct child; descendant SIGKILL is scheduled asynchronously
  and may finish after the wait returns. Descendants come from a `proc_listchildpids` walk of the
  child's own subtree (not a scan of the whole process table), snapshotted with start times before
  `terminate()`. Two limits remain: a probe that reports 0 children is still read once, because a
  spurious 0 would silently drop a descendant; and a grandchild that reparented to launchd before
  the snapshot is unreachable by any pid walk.

## Selection Retrieval

- **The coordinator runs a targeted strategy chain with native AX prioritization.**
  `retrievalMode` picks the entry point; retrieval runs that strategy and its fallbacks
  (native text controls fall back to keyboard copy unless strictly native; web areas cascade
  `ax-web-area → keyboard-copy`). Browsers resolve natively via `AXWebArea` in <1 ms with deep
  ancestor search (depth 25 + window search) and fall back to keyboard copy with a 0.6 s timeout,
  completely removing the legacy `browser-script` AppleScript subprocess churn and permission friction.
- **Web-area settle-retry exhaustion is untested.** The `.axWebArea` retry loop
  (`webAreaSettleMaxRetries` = 6, re-inspecting fresh each attempt) returns `nil` when the text
  never appears, but the exhausted path has no dedicated test — the loop is exercised only through
  fixture snapshots in `SelectionRetrievalCoordinatorTests`.
- **Copy-path clipboard visibility caveat.** The `.menuCopy`/`.keyboardCopy` engine leaves the
  captured selection on the general pasteboard for up to `pasteboardRestoreDelay` (0.8 s) before
  restoring the archived items. The restore is tagged `org.nspasteboard.TransientType` +
  `org.nspasteboard.AutoGeneratedType` so clipboard managers skip it, but anything that reads the
  pasteboard in that window (a live clipboard-manager UI, or another app polling `changeCount`) can
  observe the copied text.
- **Hold-trigger clipboard fallback is gated on an exact fire-time cursor class.** The
  `MacSelectionMonitor` hold task inherits the clipboard only when
  `CursorClassifier.current == .beam` (and paste is not denied). The classifier reads the real
  window-server cursor (`NSCursor.currentSystem` — `NSCursor.current` is process-local and
  always reported arrow for this background app, which silently disabled the whole gate until it
  was fixed). Residual limits: custom cursors whose bitmap silhouette-degrades to `.unknown`
  (some Electron/web apps) fail the strict equality even over editable fields, and a press-hold
  that makes an app swap cursors samples the swapped class.


## Test Isolation

- **Shared reset for the app singletons:** `Tests/OpenClipTests/TestIsolation.swift` centralizes
  `TestIsolation.reset()` — clears `ActionRegistry.shared`, `ActionCustomizationManager.shared`,
  `RuleEngine.shared`, and `ExtensionManager.shared` (loaded actions, `onRegister`/`onUnregister`
  callbacks, and factory). The singleton-touching test classes call it in `setUp()`, so the suite is
  order-independent. `ActionCoordinator.shared` needs no explicit reset: it mirrors the registry's
  `@Published` state, which `ActionRegistry.reset()` clears.
- **Tests must wire what they read.** A test that expects loaded extensions to land in the shared
  registry must set `ExtensionManager.shared.onRegister` itself (see
  `GoldenExtensionPlatformTests.setUp`) rather than relying on wiring left behind by an earlier
  test class. Keep using `TestIsolation.reset()` rather than cross-class state.
- **Store-backed behavior tests via `MemorySettingsStore`.** The shared in-memory test double
  (`Tests/OpenClipTests/MemorySettingsStore.swift`) replaces `UserDefaults.standard` mutation in
  `CalculateActionTests`, `ActionRegistryTests`, `GoldenExtensionPlatformTests`, and
  `ActionCustomizationTests`. Prefer it (or `DefaultSettingsStore(userDefaults: suiteName)`) over
  writing the real preferences domain.
- **Isolated in-memory test doubles and seams.** Store-backed tests use `MemorySettingsStore`
  rather than writing the real preferences domain, and `SecretActionOptionStoreTests` redirects to a
  temporary file (`SecretStore.setFileURLForTesting`),
  eliminating live system pasteboard/keychain mutation during test runs.
- **Removed slow/flaky/environment-dependent tests:** the Apple Intelligence live-model test
  (`testAppleIntelligenceMatchesPresetPrompts`) made
  real on-device `LanguageModelSession` calls; `DebugLogEndToEndTests` polled `OSLogStore`
  with multi-second sleeps; `ScriptActionTests` duplicated `ScriptActionExecutionTests`; and
  interactive popup panel/toast/search UI tests requiring live window-server positioning were
  trimmed to optimize test execution speed and keep the unit test suite fast and deterministic.
  Core domain logic, validation, action execution, and isolation tests remain fully covered.

## Logging

- **Single `Log` surface is in.** `Sources/Core/Log.swift` owns every `os.Logger` category
  (`settings`, `presentation`, `chrome`, `factory`, `coordinator`, `result-handler`, `shell`, `js`,
  `selection`, `extensions`, `ai`, `permissions`, `icons`, `updates`); all `print()` calls are gone. See
  `docs/logging.md` for the category table and filtering workflow.
- **Level budget is conservative.** Most messages are `.notice`/`.error`; `.debug` is used for
  defensive parses and transient network hiccups (filtered out by default in Console).
- **`chrome` category is reserved but unused** — no popup-window-chrome code logs yet.
- **`RotatingFileLogSink` keeps all non-`Sendable` state on its serial queue**, including
  its `DateFormatter`; its `@unchecked Sendable` depends on that rule (#45).
