# Known Debt & Current-State Realities

This file holds OpenClip's **current-state notes** — the places where the code has not yet
reached the target architecture. These change more often than the hard rules, so they are
tracked here rather than in `AGENTS.md`. Keep this file current when you touch any of these
areas; stale debt notes are worse than none.

---

## Settings Migration (UserDefaults → SettingsStore)

- The typed settings abstraction is `SettingsStore` + `SettingKey<T>` (see `Sources/Core/Settings/`).
  New settings code must route through it.
- **AI-config `@AppStorage` surface remains** (`AIServiceManager` keys), and `completionCopyToClipboard`
  / popup theme still read via `@AppStorage`, but the theme keys (`popupTheme`,
  `popupThemeColor`) now reference `SettingKey` definitions instead of raw literals. Migrating to
  `SettingsStore` is ongoing — **don't add new direct call sites.** (`startAtLogin` was consolidated
  onto `SettingKey.startAtLogin` — `LaunchAtLoginManager` persists through `DefaultSettingsStore`.)
- **Secrets live in SecretStore, not UserDefaults or macOS Keychain.** Sensitive credentials
  (the cloud AI API key and action secret options) use `SecretStore` (`~/.openclip/secrets.json`
  with 0600 POSIX permissions), replacing macOS Keychain to avoid code-signing ACL prompts.
  `AIServiceManager.cloudAPIKey` is `@Published`, backed by `SecretStore` (account `aiCloudAPIKey`);
  do not convert it back to `@AppStorage`. A one-time migration reads the old `UserDefaults`
  `"aiCloudAPIKey"` key, then deletes it.
- **`isAppEnabled` is consolidated** onto `SettingKey.isAppEnabled` — status bar, hotkey gate, and
  the Preferences toggle all read/write through `DefaultSettingsStore`. Builtin store-backed actions
  (`CalculateAction`, `CalendarAction`, `SearchAction`) accept an injected `SettingsStore` via
  `BuiltinRegistry.makeCoreBuiltins(settingsStore:)`.
- **Menu bar visibility is store-backed and reversible.** `SettingKey.showMenuBarIcon` defaults to
  true. `StatusBarController` removes/recreates its `NSStatusItem` immediately when the General-tab
  toggle changes, while reopening the running app presents Preferences so a hidden icon can be
  restored without terminating OpenClip.
- **`ActionConfigSheet` is gone** (dead code — zero presenting call sites; its `useText` keys were
  write-only). Removing it also dropped the only UI that wrote `SettingKey.searchURL` /
  `SettingKey.calculateMode`; the actions still read those keys (defaults apply). Search-engine
  configurability is **restored** via the built-in Search action's preset picker in the Preferences
  edit sheet (`DynamicActionConfigView` — Google / DuckDuckGo / Kagi / Brave / Bing / Ecosia /
  Custom), which writes the option-store key `action.builtin.search.option.url`
  (`SearchEnginePreset` in Core holds the curated catalog); calculate-result-mode still has no
  Preferences surface.
  `ConfigurableAction` keeps only `preferenceIconName` (used by `tableIcon`/`rowIcon` icon fallback).
- **Dynamic action option keys** (`JavaScriptAction`, `AppleScriptAction`): the target pattern is
  `SettingKey<String>("action.<id>.option.<identifier>", defaultValue:)` via `SettingsStore`. The JS
  path already reads through the injected `optionStore` (`OpenClipJSHost` reads options read-only via
  `ActionOptionReading`); `AppleScriptAction` does not consume options today.

## AI Providers (Claude Code CLI)

- **Resolved in 1.3.0: cancelling the popup now kills the `claude` child.** Upstream made
  `ShellProcessRunner` consult task cancellation (`ProcessBox` +
  `withTaskCancellationHandler`), and this fork's `runCapturingExit` is the same execution path,
  so `ClaudeCLIProvider`'s task cancellation terminates the child's process group immediately
  instead of leaving an orphan. The `Constants.scriptTimeout` watchdog (now **60 s**, upstream's
  script budget) remains as the upper bound; this provider passes that shared constant rather
  than a budget of its own. Either way the child writes no transcript
  (`--no-session-persistence`).
- **The Claude CLI resolution cache is deliberately not persisted.** `AIServiceManager`'s
  `claudeBinaryPath` / `claudeResolutionDetail` are `@Published` runtime state, not settings — no
  `@AppStorage`, no `SettingsStore`. A binary path goes stale across a CLI reinstall, a
  version-manager switch or a home-directory move, and a persisted stale path fails at spawn with a
  confusing error instead of simply being re-resolved. Cost: one login-shell spawn per app launch.
  Do not "fix" this by persisting it.
- **The Claude CLI provider is one-shot, not streaming.** `--output-format json` yields a single
  envelope carrying the error flag and the usage data, so `processStream` yields the finished text
  exactly once and finishes; the user sees a spinner rather than text arriving progressively. Every
  other non-browser provider streams. Changing this means giving up the envelope (and with it the
  `is_error` signal that classification depends on) for stream-json.

## Action Seams Already Implemented

- **Coordinator composition is done.** `ActionCoordinator.loadInitialState()` wires `ExtensionManager`
  to the registry via `onRegister`/`onUnregister`; the manager never calls `ActionRegistry.shared`
  directly. GUI-authored actions persist as manifest packages (via `CustomActionManifestWriter`);
  `custom_actions.json`/`CustomActionManager` are retired.
- **Shell runtimes share one executor.** `ScriptAction` script files and `CustomAction.shellScript`
  both run through `ShellProcessRunner` (one watchdog; `TimeoutFlag`/`OnceGate` live in
  `ShellProcessRunner.swift`) and translate stdout JSON via `ShellResultMapper`; `NSUserNotification`
  is gone (`.notify` is handled by the effect door via `UNUserNotificationCenter`). AppleScript
  joins the same executor via `AppleScriptRunner` (osascript subprocess), so no code runs
  `NSAppleScript` in-process anymore. Since the hang fix, the watchdog is a **GCD timer** (immune
  to Swift-concurrency-pool starvation) and pipe output is read via GCD `readabilityHandler` (never
  a blocking `readToEnd()`, so a stuck child can't permanently consume a cooperative thread), with
  stdin seeded and closed synchronously so a script reading stdin always sees EOF.
- **Delivery is resolved by `ActionResultDelivery`, not per-runtime translation.** Runtimes
  (`OpenClipJSHost.run`, `ShellResultMapper`, kind actions) return only raw results; implicitly
  returned text (JS string return, AppleScript output, shell stdout, text snippets) is emitted as
  `.text` and the paste-vs-copy/preview delivery decision (Select → Probe → Toast) is applied
  downstream from the user's per-click preference (General-tab `primaryClickBehavior`/
  `secondaryClickBehavior`) plus the action's declared `Action.delivery` (snapshotted per perform),
  the click intent, and the unified paste
  availability. The old `after` translator (the pre-refactor `after` orchestration step and its
  adapter) is **fully removed**. Async JS runs are guarded by the
  `TimeoutFlag` watchdog (60 s, same pattern as `ShellProcessRunner`) and cooperative Swift task cancellation.
- **Custom Action Groups use canonical IDs with dynamic materialization and strict $\ge 2$ member invariant.**
  User-defined action groups are defined via `ActionGroupDef` (`Sources/Core/Actions/ActionGroupDef.swift`),
  stored as JSON in `SettingKey.actionGroups`. Rather than rewriting action identifiers with virtual ID
  prefixes (e.g. `vgroup.<id>.<actionID>`), grouped actions retain their exact canonical IDs
  (`builtin.copy`, `com.user.ext.action`). `ActionRegistry` dynamically materializes `CustomGroupAction`
  (`Sources/Core/Actions/CustomGroupAction.swift`, conforming to `Action` and `SubActionProviding`)
  group rows, injecting them contiguously before their member actions in `actions`, while `SettingKey.actionOrder`
  strictly stores real, canonical IDs (excluding synthetic group headers and AI presets). `ActionCoordinator`
  manages the full group lifecycle (`createGroup`, `updateGroup`, `ungroup`, `removeFromGroup`, `loadGroupDefs`,
  `pruneOrphans`), automatically enforcing the strict $\ge 2$ member invariant: when members are uninstalled
  or removed, any group dropping below 2 members is immediately dissolved. Availability resolution in
  `ActionRegistry.availableActions(for:)` maps canonical IDs to owning custom groups to hide member actions
  when their parent group is disabled or filtered out.

## Extension JS Module Runtime

- **JS file scripts run in module mode (CommonJS).** A `javascript` action with `"script"` gets
  `require`/`module`/`exports`/`__dirname` and can split across local files; resolution is Node-style
  and contained to the package directory (`OpenClipModuleLoader` + `Constants.isPathSafe`), with
  `../`/symlink escapes, absolute paths, and bare/Node-builtin specifiers rejected. Inline
  `scriptCode` actions have no modules (byte-identical legacy behavior).
- **Third-party libraries live on the author side, not the host.** npm deps are bundled by the
  author with esbuild (`--platform=browser --target=es2020`) into `dist/main.js`; the host loader is
  **`.js`-only**, so TypeScript works only through the bundle path (`--with-npm` scaffold). Node
  builtins are rejected at build time by the esbuild platform — they can never run.
- **The consent gate has landed; capability *enforcement* remains future work.** Nothing runs until
  a package is enabled (fail-closed trust states `seen`/`trusted`/`revoked` behind a single
  trust-model consent surface), and a tamper-watch auto-disables a trusted package whose content
  hash changed at a later load. Still future: JIT permission prompts, gating `fetch`/`keyPress`/
  `runShortcut`, seeding `ManifestCapabilityGate`, and a JS honesty-scan acting on mismatches.
  Extensions still execute in-process with the app's user context; module containment bounds file
  reads but is not a privilege boundary.

## Presentation / Rule Holes

- **No `switch action.id` fallback remains.** `ActionCustomizationManager.tableIcon()` resolves via
  `ConfigurableAction.preferenceIconName` — the legacy block is gone. Keep it that way: never add
  id-string switches in presentation.

## Action-Search Palette & Popup Growth

- **Content-driven panel growth has no controller callback.** The `NSHostingView` auto-resizes the
  panel window top-anchored when its SwiftUI content grows (e.g. entering search mode);
  `onPreferenceChange`/`onContentSizeChange` never fires for this and `sizingOptions` has no effect.
  The only reliable hook is `PopupPanel.setFrame` (`PopupPanel.swift:42`): when
  `pinBottomEdgeOnResize` is set it keeps the bottom edge fixed so results-above-the-field growth
  never shoves the popup. The pin stays active through the search→bar collapse (Esc no longer jumps
  the popup) and is cleared by `show(for:)` (`PopupWindowController.swift:69`) and `hide()`
  (`:464`) before intentional placement.
- **Search and content modes are the two key exceptions to the never-key rule.** `PopupPanel.allowsKey`
  enables `canBecomeKey`/`canBecomeMain` in both modes (`PopupPanel.swift:19`), routed through the
  same `enterKeyMode()`/`exitKeyMode()` primitives (`PopupWindowController.swift:196,206`). A
  `@FocusState`-in-onAppear request is silently dropped on macOS, so search forces focus via
  `focusSearchField()` on the next run-loop turn (`PopupWindowController.swift:245`);
  `previousFrontmostApp` is captured once per session (on `show(for:)`/`enterKeyMode`, never
  re-captured mid-session) and re-activated on `exitKeyMode`/`hide`.
- **Search and content modes suspend popup dismissal.** The distance auto-dismiss and the key/scroll
  dismissals in `handleEvent` are skipped while `modeStore.mode == .search` or `.content`
  (`PopupWindowController.swift:591,612,622`), so typing with the mouse elsewhere doesn't close the
  palette, and the result card stays open until it is collapsed or the popup hides.
- **The floating bubble panel is gone; content renders inline.** The second `PopupPanel` (and its
  `showBubble`/`hideBubble`/`bubbleBlocksDismiss` machinery) was removed — all action/AI/status
  content renders inside the single panel via `.content` mode (`PopupModeStore`) as a native
  SwiftUI `ResultCardView`. The card is general, not AI-specific: any text-returning action lands
  there with its customization-resolved icon (`DeliveryContext.actionIcon`, snapshotted by the same
  perform paths as `actionTitle`); AI streaming deliveries pass no icon and keep the sparkles glyph. `StatusBadgeModel` and the old `.info`/`.result`/`.menu` emphasis
  model are gone, and the inline status banner is gone too: every `StatusFeedback` renders as a
  floating toast (`ToastPanelController`) with no queue — a status shows over the card — and
  `showsLoading` actions (manifest `"loading"`) use the early-close spinner toast.
- **`MathEvaluator` replaced crash-prone `NSExpression`.** `CalculateAction` used to run
  `NSExpression(format:)`, which throws an **uncaught Objective-C exception** on malformed selection
  text like `+` or `1+` (crash). The pure-Swift `MathEvaluator` (`Sources/Core/Actions/MathEvaluator.swift`)
  returns nil (never traps) and properly supports `%` modulo. Regression coverage in
  `Tests/OpenClipTests/CalculateActionTests.swift`.
- **Search rows render icons strictly `[icon | text]`.** A `.text` icon in the icon column would
  duplicate the title, so `PopupSearchView.rowIcon` falls back to `ConfigurableAction.preferenceIconName`; all four
  `ActionIcon` cases render through the shared `ActionIconView` (`Sources/OpenClip/UI/Icons/ActionIconView.swift`),
  including Iconify-format symbols (`prefix:name`). The popup bar keeps its own `iconView(for:)`
  (`PopupView.swift`) because text icons there need natural width + horizontal padding, not a fixed frame.
- **Popup sizing constants live in the App target.** `PopupMetrics`
  (`Sources/OpenClip/UI/Popup/PopupMetrics.swift`) holds the UI-only values — `searchMaxRows`
  (5), `searchResultRowHeight` (32), `searchPeekRowFraction` (0.5), `popupMaxHeight` (300, the
  shared height cap for the popup panel), the AI card bounds (`aiCardMinWidth` 220 /
  `aiCardIdealWidth` 300 / `aiCardMaxWidth` 360 / `aiCardBodyHeight` 160), plus
  placement/dismissal distances. `Core/Selection/Constants.swift` keeps only
  domain/runtime constants (timeouts, key codes, env vars, manifest keys).

## Unused / Latent

- **`ActionContext.modifiers` is currently unused.** No action reads it; `PopupWindowController`
  passes `modifiers: []`. The click intent itself *is* plumbed: `ActionContext.isSecondaryClick` is
  set from
  the captured `pendingClickIntent` by the bar/palette perform paths (right-click always; ⇧-click
  via the `onClickIntent` closure) and read by `DefineAction` to copy a definition headlessly. True
  modifier keys (⌘/⌥) still don't reach actions.
- **Paste delivery is now standardized but has a probe reliance.** Leaf `.paste` results are
  re-decided by `ActionResultDelivery` (App target) per the rule in the dev-guide §5b: a secondary
  click uses the declared `secondary` outcome (else derives `.copy` from a `.paste` primary), and
  the **unified** `PasteAvailability` answer (per-app rules win, AX `PasteAvailabilityProbe` fills
  in) downgrades a chosen `.paste` to `.copy` when it says no; otherwise the requested paste is
  honored. The delivery inputs are snapshotted at perform time — before
  the dismissing `hide()` clears the session context — so `denyPaste` holds even for pastes that
  dismiss the popup, and the AI card's Paste/Copy buttons are explicit requests
  (`performCardEffect`) that carry no delivery context and are never re-decided. The live probe
  (`PasteAvailabilityProbe`) needs
  Accessibility permission and
  walks the target's Edit ▸ Paste AX menu item; without AX it returns "unknown" and delivery falls
  back to copy (safe but means paste never happens for AX-less users). The same unified decision drives
  `modeStore.canPaste`, which hides the card's Paste button and the bar/search Paste + Cut
  (`PasteRequiringAction`) actions on a confirmed cannot-paste; unknown keeps them visible. The
  probe is started by the trigger sites in parallel with selection retrieval and applied before the
  first frame (probe-before-render, nothing cached), so a same-app focus-context change re-probes
  cleanly. The click-intent capture reads
  only ⇧ (not ⌘/⌥) and only sets it on mouse-down; a keyboard-driven run (search palette Enter) uses
  the last left-click intent. Since Task 4, each action's declared `Action.delivery` (a distinct
  secondary outcome + per-click `primaryToast`/`secondaryToast`) is snapshotted alongside the click
  intent and fed into `resolve`, and the returned tuple's toast is rendered directly — the manual
  `isDowngradedToCopy`/`isCopyDefinition` inline toast detection was removed in favor of the resolved
  `.toast`. Since Task 8, a script-emitted `.toast` (or any result whose `containsToast` is true)
  suppresses the delivery companion toast entirely — one toast per run — and `keepVisible: true`
  stops a toast's auto-dismiss and keeps the popup open (a `.toast` dismisses by default). Only the
  SwiftUI inline perform path snapshots via the new `onWillPerformAction` closure;
  the completion-button paste path (`PopupView` `onResult(.paste(word))`) routes through
  `deliverResult`, which clears `pendingDelivery` right after its snapshot (single-use per perform),
  so a prior non-dismissing action's declared delivery can never leak onto a completion paste. The
  force-copy probe short-circuit skips the AX walk for a secondary click whose outcome is a copy;
  a declared `.paste` secondary is the exception and still probes, so it is honored when the target
  can paste (and downgrades to copy when it cannot). Since Task 3, implicitly returned text
  (runtimes emit `.text`, never auto-dismissing) is resolved per the user's per-click preference
  from the two General-tab settings (`preference(for:)`, unknown values fall back to primary-paste/
  secondary-copy): a paste preference probes like any paste and downgrades to copy when the target
  can't paste, a copy preference delivers a native copy with no toast, and a preview preference keeps
  the popup open for the card render (Task 4) — dismissal for `.text` is decided by the controller's
  `shouldDismiss`, not `dismissesPopup`. The loading re-show path (`settleLoadingResult`)
  re-creates the popup from the pre-early-close selection snapshot to present the card.
  - **Target application and delivery context snapshotted before perform.** Asynchronous actions snapshot
    the target application, app policy, and declared delivery into an `inFlightDeliveryContext` (or local task
    constant) before performing. If the user switches applications while an asynchronous action is executing,
    `resolveDelivery` detects that the target application is no longer active and safely downgrades `.paste`
    to `.copy` with a "Copied" toast to prevent pasting into the newly focused application.
  - **Re-show binds to the current frontmost app.** The loading-preview re-show
    (`settleLoadingResult`) re-creates the popup from the selection snapshot, but `hide()`
    clears `previousFrontmostApp`, so the re-show re-captures whatever is frontmost at settle
    time — if the user switched apps during a multi-second spinner, dismissal reactivates that
    app. The card's paste probe correctly targets the snapshotted app; only dismissal's
    reactivation is affected.
  - **`.text` inside a `.sequence` is unhandled.** Runtimes emit `.text` only as a lone result
    today, so a `.text` inside a sequence is defensive-only; if the runtime surface ever grows to
    emit `.text` in sequences, the tree-walk needs explicit handling.
- **HotkeyManager.executor pattern** (`HotkeyManager.swift:22`): a latent `Task { @MainActor in`
  inside the shortcut callback could be hardened to an explicit executor; optional.

## Concurrency

- **Residual non-interruptible paths (documented).** Two spots remain that a hostile
  or hung target can make block a background thread:
  (1) `SelectionRetrievalCoordinator.pressEditCopyMenu` fires an AXPress on the dedicated
  `com.openclip.ax-inspect` queue that the `pasteboardCopyTimeout` poll does not kill — the press
  is uncancellable and may pin a queue worker thread against a hung target until the AX call
  returns (never bounded by the copy timeout). The queue is concurrent, so a stuck press no longer
  head-of-line-blocks later retrieval requests (see below);
  (2) an async-mode
  JS script with a top-level *synchronous* infinite loop blocks inside `evaluateScript`, which the
  watchdog pump loop never reaches (the sync-evaluation gate covers only `isAsync == false`).
  Neither path is main-actor-blocking.
- **AX inspect is deadline-capped.** `SelectionRetrievalCoordinator.inspectWithWatchdog` races
  `AXElementInspector.inspect` against
  `Constants.axReadTimeout` (0.5 s) via the `OnceResume` once-gate, running the blocking snapshot on
  the dedicated `com.openclip.ax-inspect` queue; an unresponsive app returns
  `nil` to the retrieval chain instead of hanging the popup.
- **Inspect concurrency is bounded, not serialized.** The old single fail-fast `axSlot` made every
  overlapping gesture (rapid re-selection, double-click, hotkey+monitor races) miss entirely and
  stayed occupied until the underlying AX call returned — one heavy page suppressed popups
  process-wide for seconds. Reads now go through a counting gate (`Constants.axMaxConcurrentInspects`,
  currently 4): concurrent reads proceed in parallel, the permit frees when the caller's watchdog
  settles (deadline or completion), and only genuinely saturated bursts skip. Menu-copy presses
  share the same gate for serialization.
- **The `ax-inspect` queue is concurrent, not head-of-line blocking.** All blocking AX work in the
  coordinator (the inspect snapshot and the Edit ▸ Copy AXPress) shares one concurrent
  `com.openclip.ax-inspect` queue: a hung AX call occupies one worker thread but later inspect
  snapshots and presses start on other threads, so a slow or stuck target no longer delays the next
  request's start. Each request still gets its own `axReadTimeout` deadline race.
  (`PasteAvailabilityProbe` deliberately keeps its own `ax-probe` queue plus a
  probe-slot gate so a stalled probe never spawns extra blocked workers.)
- **Subprocess pipe reads are non-blocking (hang fix).** `ShellProcessRunner` previously read stdout/
  stderr with blocking `readToEnd()` tasks and a `Task.sleep` watchdog — both can be starved, so a
  child (or grandchild) holding a pipe open could wedge the cooperative pool and hang the test
  suite indefinitely (observed mid-suite in `ScriptActionTests.testScriptExecution`). The runner now
  uses a GCD timer watchdog + GCD `readabilityHandler` reads + synchronous stdin close. This claim
  covers only the pipe reads: `process.waitUntilExit()` still blocks its detached thread until the
  child exits — bounded at `Constants.scriptTimeout`, when the watchdog kills the child and the wait
  returns.

## Selection Retrieval

- **The coordinator runs a targeted strategy chain with native AX prioritization.**
  `retrievalMode` picks the entry point; retrieval runs that strategy and its fallbacks
  (native text controls fall back to keyboard copy unless strictly native; web areas cascade
  `ax-web-area → keyboard-copy`). Browsers resolve natively via `AXWebArea` in <1 ms with deep
  ancestor search (depth 25 + window search) and fall back to keyboard copy with a 0.6 s timeout,
  completely removing the legacy `browser-script` AppleScript subprocess churn and permission friction.
- **Web-area settle-retry exhaustion is untested.** The `.axWebArea` retry loop
  (`webAreaSettleMaxRetries` = 6, re-inspecting fresh each attempt) returns `nil` when the text
  never appears, but the exhausted path has no dedicated test — the loop is exercised only through
  fixture snapshots in `SelectionRetrievalCoordinatorTests`.
- **Copy-path clipboard visibility caveat.** The `.menuCopy`/`.keyboardCopy` engine leaves the
  captured selection on the general pasteboard for up to `pasteboardRestoreDelay` (0.8 s) before
  restoring the archived items. The restore is tagged `org.nspasteboard.TransientType` +
  `org.nspasteboard.AutoGeneratedType` so clipboard managers skip it, but anything that reads the
  pasteboard in that window (a live clipboard-manager UI, or another app polling `changeCount`) can
  observe the copied text.
- **Hold-trigger clipboard fallback is gated on an exact fire-time cursor class.** The
  `MacSelectionMonitor` hold task inherits the clipboard only when
  `CursorClassifier.current == .beam` (and paste is not denied). The classifier reads the real
  window-server cursor (`NSCursor.currentSystem` — `NSCursor.current` is process-local and
  always reported arrow for this background app, which silently disabled the whole gate until it
  was fixed). Residual limits: custom cursors whose bitmap silhouette-degrades to `.unknown`
  (some Electron/web apps) fail the strict equality even over editable fields, and a press-hold
  that makes an app swap cursors samples the swapped class.


## Test Isolation

- **Shared reset for the app singletons:** `Tests/OpenClipTests/TestIsolation.swift` centralizes
  `TestIsolation.reset()` — clears `ActionRegistry.shared`, `ActionCustomizationManager.shared`,
  `RuleEngine.shared`, and `ExtensionManager.shared` (loaded actions, `onRegister`/`onUnregister`
  callbacks, and factory). The singleton-touching test classes call it in `setUp()`, so the suite is
  order-independent. `ActionCoordinator.shared` needs no explicit reset: it mirrors the registry's
  `@Published` state, which `ActionRegistry.reset()` clears.
- **Tests must wire what they read.** A test that expects loaded extensions to land in the shared
  registry must set `ExtensionManager.shared.onRegister` itself (see
  `GoldenExtensionPlatformTests.setUp`) rather than relying on wiring left behind by an earlier
  test class. Keep using `TestIsolation.reset()` rather than cross-class state.
- **Store-backed behavior tests via `MemorySettingsStore`.** The shared in-memory test double
  (`Tests/OpenClipTests/MemorySettingsStore.swift`) replaces `UserDefaults.standard` mutation in
  `CalculateActionTests`, `ActionRegistryTests`, `GoldenExtensionPlatformTests`, and
  `ActionCustomizationTests`. Prefer it (or `DefaultSettingsStore(userDefaults: suiteName)`) over
  writing the real preferences domain.
- **Isolated in-memory test doubles and seams.** Store-backed tests use `MemorySettingsStore`
  rather than writing the real preferences domain, `SecretActionOptionStoreTests` redirects to a
  temporary file (`SecretStore.setFileURLForTesting`), and `TextRetrieverTests` injects a stub coordinator,
  eliminating live system pasteboard/keychain mutation during test runs.
- **Removed slow/flaky/environment-dependent tests:** the Apple Intelligence live-model test
  (`testAppleIntelligenceMatchesPresetPrompts`) made
  real on-device `LanguageModelSession` calls; `DebugLogEndToEndTests` polled `OSLogStore`
  with multi-second sleeps; and `ScriptActionTests` duplicated `ScriptActionExecutionTests` (its
  stdin-reading test was the observed hang point). Core validation tests for those paths remain
  (pure validation, no live model/activation).

## Logging

- **Single `Log` surface is in.** `Sources/Core/Log.swift` owns every `os.Logger` category
  (`settings`, `presentation`, `chrome`, `factory`, `coordinator`, `result-handler`, `shell`, `js`,
  `selection`, `extensions`, `ai`, `permissions`, `icons`, `updates`); all `print()` calls are gone. See
  `docs/logging.md` for the category table and filtering workflow.
- **Level budget is conservative.** Most messages are `.notice`/`.error`; `.debug` is used for
  defensive parses and transient network hiccups (filtered out by default in Console).
- **`chrome` category is reserved but unused** — no popup-window-chrome code logs yet.
