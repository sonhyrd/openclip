# Installation & Onboarding Guide

Welcome to OpenClip! This guide will walk you through installing OpenClip on macOS, granting required permissions, and configuring your initial setup.

---

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later.
- **Architecture**: Universal binary (Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3/M4 & Intel processors).
- **Permissions**: Accessibility permission is required for global text selection detection.

The interface follows the macOS system language. English and Simplified Chinese are bundled.

## Installation Steps

1. **Download OpenClip**: Download the latest release `.dmg` or `.zip` file from the official releases page.
2. **Move to Applications**: Drag `OpenClip.app` into your `/Applications` folder.
3. **Launch OpenClip**: Open `OpenClip.app` from Finder or Spotlight.

Releases are signed with an Apple Developer ID certificate and notarized by Apple, so OpenClip
opens normally. There is no need to right-click to open it, and no need to strip a quarantine
attribute with `xattr`. If macOS says the app "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be
verified", the download is not a release build — check where it came from.

To confirm what you have before launching it:

```bash
spctl -a -vv -t exec /Applications/OpenClip.app
# accepted
# source=Notarized Developer ID

xcrun stapler validate /Applications/OpenClip.app
# The validate action worked!
```

## Granting Accessibility Permissions

OpenClip relies on macOS Accessibility APIs (`AXUIElement`) to detect text selection events and extract selected text directly without polluting your clipboard.

```
System Settings ---> Privacy & Security ---> Accessibility ---> Enable OpenClip
```

1. On first launch, OpenClip will prompt you to grant Accessibility permissions.
2. Click **Open System Settings**.
3. Navigate to **Privacy & Security > Accessibility**.
4. Toggle the switch next to **OpenClip** to **On**.
5. Authenticate with your Mac password or Touch ID.

> [!NOTE]
> OpenClip reads selected text strictly in real-time when mouse drag or selection events occur. No keystrokes or selection histories are logged or stored locally.

## First-Launch Onboarding Workflow

When launched for the first time, OpenClip presents a 4-step onboarding wizard:

1. **Welcome**: Concept overview of turning selected text into instant contextual actions.
2. **Access**: Accessibility permission check with 100% on-device privacy guarantee.
3. **Extensions**: Recommended essential extensions (translations, word count, speech) with one-click installation.
4. **Try It**: Interactive live playground sandbox to test text selection and see the real action bar in action.

Onboarding can be skipped at any step; finishing it starts text-selection monitoring. You can also trigger the popup anytime with the global shortcut (**⌥⌘C** by default), configure AI providers anytime in **Preferences → AI**, and customize the popup bar's theme in **Preferences → Appearance**.
