# release_update.sh
#
# Builds a Release archive, signs it with a Developer ID certificate, notarizes and staples it,
# zips it, generates a Sparkle appcast.xml signed with an Ed25519 private key, and packages a
# .dmg that is signed, notarized, and stapled in its own right. The resulting .zip, .dmg, and
# appcast.xml are ready to upload to a GitHub Release.
#
# A release is required to be signed and notarized. Anything less does not open on a machine
# other than the one that built it, so the script refuses to produce one rather than emitting an
# artifact that looks fine locally and fails for every user.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   1. Generate Ed25519 keys once:
#        ./scripts/bin/generate_keys --account openclip
#      This saves the private key to your macOS Keychain and prints the public
#      key (add to Info.plist SUPublicEDKey).
#
#   2. For CI (GitHub Actions), export the private key as a secret:
#        SPARKLE_ED_PRIVATE_KEY=<base64 private key>
#
#   3. A "Developer ID Application" certificate in the keychain, named by
#        OPENCLIP_SIGN_IDENTITY (or "auto" to pick the only one), and notary credentials in
#        NOTARY_PROFILE or NOTARY_KEY/NOTARY_KEY_ID/NOTARY_ISSUER. Locally these can all live in
#        the gitignored keys/signing.env. See scripts/signing_config.sh.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/release_update.sh [version]
#
# Example:
#   ./scripts/release_update.sh 1.2.0
#   → build/release/OpenClip-v1.2.0.zip   (signed, notarized, stapled)
#   → build/release/OpenClip-v1.2.0.dmg   (signed, notarized, stapled)
#   → build/release/appcast.xml
#
# OPENCLIP_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_RELEASE=1 downgrades the whole run to an ad-hoc build with the
# notarization steps skipped. It exists so the release pipeline can still be exercised end to end
# without certificates; artifacts it produces must not be published.
