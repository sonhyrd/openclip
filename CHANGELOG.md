# OpenClip Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to OpenClip.

## v1.6.2 - 2026-09-20

### Features & Improvements
- **Native file output and interactive preview card**: JavaScript actions, shell scripts, and extensions can return files via `ActionResult.file`, `ActionResult.copyFile`, or `ActionResult.saveFile`, with interactive preview cards, Quick Look, drag-and-drop, and configurable save location.
- **Inbound `openclip://` automation API**: other apps can read and write a curated set of settings and run app-level commands (`open-settings`, `pause`, `resume`, `reset-appearance`).
- **Popup card chrome**: lit top rim, gradient hairline, and contact + ambient shadows; diff and pin controls hover-reveal.
- **Popup bottom fade**: content fades at the bottom edge instead of a material band; inset Actions-list separators.
- **Browser front-window opens**: browser-sourced URLs open through the browser's scripting, so private/incognito windows get a tab in the current window.
- **Define opens in Dictionary.app** from the result card.
- **Rich pasteboard fidelity**: copy and paste preserve every representation, including app-private types.
- **Inline results stay warm** across popups and repacks.
- **Actions list rework**: clearer rows, search, and drag-and-drop grouping; deleting a custom action removes it from its groups and clears its alias.
- **Hold-to-trigger** now works with **Appear Automatically** off.
- **Keyboard selection reads** without the copy-evidence gate.

### Fixes & Stability
- **Popup shadow**: no longer clipped, with the transparent ring derived from the shadow geometry.
- **Click intent**: resolved once per run, fixing right-click bleed and the wrong ⇧⏎ copy/paste outcome.
- **Log timestamps** format on the rotating file sink's own serial queue.
- **Settings**: sidebar search strip and last-pane restore.
- **Sub-bar results**: an in-flight inline evaluation is joined, not re-run.
- **Action editor**: option labels show as field prompts.
- **PowerPoint selection**: fixed via OpenSelection 0.2.3; KeyboardShortcuts 3.1.0.

## v1.6.1 - 2026-09-16

### Features & Improvements
- **Apple Intelligence availability** is reported in Preferences › AI, with how to fix each state.
- **More reliable Apple Intelligence answers** via guided generation.
- **Inline results in sub-action bars** match the main bar.
- **Dependency update**: OpenSelection 0.1.2.

### Fixes & Stability
- **Overlay-safe selection reads**: no synthetic ⌘C while a foreign overlay owns the key window.
- **Result card stays on screen** as it resizes.
- **Empty-state hint** points custom actions to Actions.

---

## v1.6.0 - 2026-09-14

### First signed & notarized release
- **First genuinely signed, hardened, and notarized release** (app and DMG); every earlier build was ad-hoc and could not be notarized.
- **Re-grant Accessibility once** when upgrading from an ad-hoc build; Developer ID signing makes it survive future updates.
- **Fresh installs** open with no Gatekeeper warning.

### Features & Improvements
- **Settings rebuilt like System Settings**: one router, a searchable sidebar, and a page for every extension, built-in action, and custom action.
- **Ask AI from the palette**, including **Save as AI tool**; ⏎ shows the answer and ⇧⏎ replaces the selection.
- **Refine answers in the result card** with an inline follow-up, diffed against the original selection.
- **AI engines**: local CLIs and universal local models with automatic model resolution.
- **Duplication, pinning, and a sortable Store** with real publish dates.
- **Store**: sort options, publish dates, offline and update states, and **Install from File…**.
- **Result card and actions**: duplicate extensions and custom actions; pin button; frozen size while streaming; selection engine extracted to OpenSelection 0.1.1.

### Security & Distribution
- **Inside-out signing and notarization**: no `codesign --deep`; app and DMG are signed deepest-first, verified, and stapled, failing on any non-distributable artifact.

### Fixes & Stability
- Single-command extension pages render correctly and the hero scrolls with the page.
- Sidebar search has its own strip; the page switch no longer stretches; Store sort moved into the page.
- Follow-up keeps focus so Esc cancels; refinement never reopens a dismissed card.

### Contributors
- **Matej Bačo (@Meldiron)** — Developer ID signing, hardened runtime, and notarization; palette Ask AI; in-place result-card refinement; unified Settings window.
- **Ganesh M (@ganeshmshetty)** — AI CLI tools, universal local models, and model resolution; inline extension results.
- **JTOBIN (@binjto-boop)** — rebuilt the preferences window on stock AppKit controls.

## v1.5.0 - 2026-09-10

### Features & Improvements
- **Resizable result cards and search palette** with remembered maximum dimensions.
- **Per-action global hotkeys and search aliases.**
- **Extension group and sub-action reordering** via drag-and-drop, with custom member icons.
- **Universal binaries** (Apple Silicon + Intel) with verification across archives and DMGs.
- **In-app updater release notes** via Sparkle 2.9.
- **Redesigned DMG installer** with a branded, Retina background.
- **Custom icon importing** (SF Symbols, SVG, PNG).
- **Per-command extension settings** shown inline when options are declared.
- **Synchronous palette resolution and prewarming** to cut trigger latency.
- **Extension Store refresh button** and single-line descriptions.
- **Visual polish**: neutral selection highlights and capped toasts.

### Security & Distribution
- **Signed, hardened, and notarized builds** (app and DMG) open without a Gatekeeper warning.
- **Accessibility permission survives updates** with a Developer ID signature.
- **Minimal entitlements**: one exception for Apple events; the release scripts fail on any mismatch.

## v1.4.0 - 2026-09-07

### Features & Improvements
- **Visual before-and-after text diffs** in result cards.
- **Screen-space floating tooltips** that never clip.
- **Palette row keyboard shortcuts** (⌘1–⌘9 and alphanumeric).
- **Preferences and action-configuration fixes**, including editor persistence and Dock restore.
- **Process lifecycle cleanup** that kills descendant process trees.
- **Hardened AI presets** against prompt injection.

### Fixes & Stability
- Paste probe starvation recovery with aggregate deadlines.
- Zero idle CPU during toast dismissals.
- Selection permit released when `Edit ▸ Copy` is blocked.
- Hermetic, fully isolated test suite.

### Contributors
- **Matej Bačo (@Meldiron)** — action editor persistence; `dev_run.sh` improvements.
- **Jtobin (@binjto-boop)** — Settings window Dock restore.
- **Md (@md786-dotcom)** — descendant process termination; paste probe recovery.
- **Ganesh M (@ganeshmshetty)** — diff engine, tooltips, AI hardening, test refactor.

## v1.3.2 - 2026-09-05

First release published from this fork's own update feed. Same app as v1.3.1 upstream, plus the fork's Claude Code CLI provider — and, critically, an installed build now updates to **fork** releases instead of being replaced by an upstream one that has no Claude CLI provider at all.

### Fork
- **Own Sparkle feed and signing key**: `SUFeedURL` points at `sonhyrd/openclip` releases, signed with this fork's Ed25519 key.
- **Tagged releases build themselves**: pushing a `v*` tag builds, signs and publishes the zip, dmg and appcast.

---

## v1.3.1 - 2026-09-05

### Features & Improvements
- **Direct action search** via shortcut, centered and focused, dismissed with Escape.
- **Search alignment clamping** within the bar and screen.
- **Layered glass contrast** with an adaptive scrim and specular borders.
- **Preferences label updates**: "Horizontal Position" and "Popup Width".

### Fixes & Stability
- **Extension Store resilience**: retries, loading states, and offline diagnostics.

### Fork Additions (sonhyrd/openclip)
- **Claude Code CLI Provider**: AI actions can run on the local `claude` binary against your own Claude subscription — no API key. Isolated invocation (pinned dated model, no tools, no MCP, no settings sources, no session persistence) with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` stripped from the child environment.
- **No stray file-access prompts**: the `claude` child runs in an empty private working directory instead of inheriting OpenClip's `/`, so its startup directory walk can no longer reach `~/Desktop`, `~/Documents` or `~/Downloads` and raise macOS consent dialogs.
- **Fork update feed**: updates now come from this fork's releases, so a fork build is never replaced by an upstream release that has no Claude CLI provider.

## v1.3.0 - 2026-09-04

### Features & Improvements
- **`openclip.pasteboard` JavaScript API** for reading, inspecting, and writing clipboard content.
- **Customizable popup alignment and vertical position**, with synchronized sub-action bars.
- **Full multilingual localization**: Traditional Chinese, French, Japanese, plus multilingual search keywords.
- **Storefront and Actions overhaul**: category tabs, pagination, and drag-and-drop.
- **Snooze and per-app pause** from the status bar menu.

### Fixes & Stability
- Extension security: blocked path traversal and unauthorized script execution.
- Clipboard preservation for lazy pasteboard items.
- App-switch paste races; secret-staging permission race.
- Release notes in update prompts; settings preserved across updates.

---

## v1.0.0 - 2026-08-21

The initial major release — a native floating action bar that turns selected text into instant actions.

### Highlights
- **Floating action bar**: contextual trigger, adaptive positioning, three themes, hover feedback, and clipboard fallback.
- **Built-in actions**: web search, calculator, dictionary, word completion, text transformations, and macOS Services/Share.
- **Search palette**: global **Option+Command+C** shortcut with recent-action ranking.
- **AI assistants**: Apple Intelligence, Ollama, OpenAI, or Anthropic, with streaming result cards and insert/replace.
- **Extensions**: in-app store, no-code custom actions, a 9,000+ icon library, and JavaScript / AppleScript / Shell / URL / Shortcuts runtimes.
- **Customization and privacy**: per-app rules, action reordering, 100% local operation, Keychain storage, subprocess isolation, and start at login.
