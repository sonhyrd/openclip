// AppleScriptRunner.swift
// OpenClip
//
// Bounded off-main strategy for AppleScript execution. In-process
// `NSAppleScript.executeAndReturnError` blocks the calling thread until the target application
// answers over Apple Events and cannot be cancelled or timed out — a hung `tell application` would
// permanently park a cooperative-pool thread (NSAppleScript is also not thread-safe across
// instances). Running each script as an `/usr/bin/osascript` subprocess through the shared
// ShellProcessRunner keeps the cooperative pool free and makes the evaluation killable: the
// watchdog terminates the subprocess at `Constants.scriptTimeout`, so a stuck script can never
// wedge a thread forever. See docs/runtimes/applescript.md.
