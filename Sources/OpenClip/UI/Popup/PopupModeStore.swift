// Shared observable mode state for the popup: the screen mode (actions bar / search palette /
// native result card) and the payloads those screens render (result card payload). Statuses
// render as a floating toast via ToastPanelController, not through the store. The real popup
// observes the store injected by PopupWindowController; the static
// preview uses a throwaway store so it never affects the live popup (mirrors the PopupHoverState
// shared + opt-in-static pattern).
