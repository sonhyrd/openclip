// PopupWindowController.swift
// OpenClip
//
// Manages the window lifecycle, event tracking, positioning, and animation of the main floating popup panel.
// Owns the popup mode state machine (actions bar ↔ action-search palette ↔ native result card): search
// mode makes the panel key (a scoped exception to the never-key rule) and restores focus to the
// previous app on exit; content mode renders the result card inline on the panel and — since
// Task 14 — is also key, reusing the same enterKeyMode()/exitKeyMode() primitives as search, with
// Esc owned by the SwiftUI card (the controller-level key monitor stays observation-only in
// content mode, bar the one case where the card lost key). Content mode is also the one mode that
// survives everything but an explicit answer: `cardIsModal` suppresses every automatic dismissal
// (outside click, scroll, cursor distance, app switch) so the card lives until Copy, Paste or Esc.
// Implements the decision-8 ActionResult tree-walk (handleActionResult): presentation results render
// here, leaf effects route to DefaultActionResultHandler, and dismissal is decided once via
// ActionResult.dismissesPopup.
